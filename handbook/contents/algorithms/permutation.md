## Sample questions

- You are given a 7 digit phone number, and you should find all possible letter combinations based on the digit-to-letter mapping on numeric pad and return only the ones that have valid match against a given dictionary of words.
- Give all possible letter combinations from a phone number.
- Generate all subsets of a string.
- Print all possible `N` pairs of balanced parentheses.
  - E.g. when `N` is `2`, the function should print `(())` and `()()`.
  - E.g. when `N` is `3`, we should get `((()))`, `(()())`, `(())()`, `()(())`, `()()()`.

- Given a list of arrays, return a list of arrays, where each array is a combination of one element in each given array.
  - E.g. If the input is `[[1, 2, 3], [4], [5, 6]]`, the output should be `[[1, 4, 5], [1, 4, 6], [2, 4, 5], [2, 4, 6], [3, 4, 5], [3, 4, 6]]`.
