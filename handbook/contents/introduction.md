## What is this?

The **Tech Interview Handbook** contains carefully curated content to help you ace your next technical interview with a focus on algorithms. While there are a ton of interview resources on the internet, the best ones are either not free, or they do not cover the complete interview process, usually only focusing on algorithms.

## Why do I want this?

This repository has **practical** content that covers all phases of a technical interview, from applying for a job to passing the interviews to offer negotiation. Technically competent candidates might still find the non-technical content helpful as well.

## Who is this for?

Whether you are a beginner to technical interviews or a seasoned engineer who have not been on the other side of the interviewing table in a while and want to get back into the game, the Tech Interview Handbook has got you covered.
